Title: 

Giftify

Objective:

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the design and development of a gift recommendation mobile application using React Native framework. 
The app aims to assist users in finding suitable gift ideas for loved-ones based on recipient preferences and other relevant factors.
The objective of the gift recommendation app is to simplify the gift selection process by providing personalized recommendations.
The app will consider factors such as recipient's age, gender, interests to generate suitable gift suggestions.

Features and Functionality :

The gift recommendation app will include the following key features:
 User Registration and Authentication:
Users can register and create their profiles using email, social media accounts, or Google sign-in.User authentication ensures secure access to personalized recommendations
and saved preferences.

GraphQL Integration:

The app integrates GraphQL as a query language and runtime for efficient data retrieval and management.GraphQL enables optimized queries by allowing clients to request only 
the required data, reducing network overhead.

Firestore Integration:

Our app integrates Firestore, a NoSQL document database, for efficient data storage and synchronization.Firestore enables real-time data updates, ensuring users receive the
latest recommendations and updates.

Gift Selection:

Users can input recipient details such as age, gender, and occasion.The app will allow users to specify interests, hobbies, or preferences of the recipient.

Recommendation Engine:

The app will employ a recommendation engine to generate personalized gift suggestions based on user input and historical data.The recommendation engine will use selection 
statements to analyze user preferences, recipient information, and product data to generate relevant gift ideas.

Search and Filtering:

Users can search for specific gift items or browse through different categories.Filtering options will be provided to narrow down search results based on interest ,age,
gender or other criteria.

Recommended gift options:

Detailed information about each recommended gift item will be provided. Atleast three options will be recommended.

Wishlist and Favorites:

Users can save gift ideas to their wishlist or mark items as favorites for future reference. Wishlist and favorites functionality will enhance user experience and allow
easy tracking of selected items.

Technology Stack:

The gift recommendation app will be developed using the following technologies:

React Native: A cross-platform framework for building mobile applications so we have developed our application using react-native framework.
Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.

RESTful API:

 To handle communication between the mobile app and the backend server.
 
Component-based architecture:

We have used component-based design pattern which composing reusable components. This pattern promotes reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

Development Process:

 The development process for the gift recommendation app will follow an Agile methodology, allowing iterative development and frequent feedback cycles.
 
 The process will involve the following stages:
 
•	Requirement Gathering and Analysis.
•	Identify the target audience and their needs.
•	Define the core features and functionality of the app.

Design and Prototyping:

Create wireframes and design the user interface using component-based pattern to seprate the concerns.Develop interactive prototypes for user testing and feedback.

Conclusion:

The gift recommendation app developed using React Native provides users with a convenient and personalized solution for selecting gifts for various occasions with its 
robust recommendation engine and  intuitive user interface,
